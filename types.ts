// This file can be used for shared TypeScript types and interfaces.
// For this application, it's currently not strictly necessary
// as component props are defined locally and API responses are simple strings.

// Example:
// export interface UserProfile {
//   id: string;
//   name: string;
//   email: string;
// }

export {}; // Ensures this file is treated as a module.
